            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Being a student at an engineering school, I've got a ton of projects under my belt, including published research!</p>
            <h3>Ongoing</h3>
            <h4>Ray-Tracing Engine with OpenGL</h4>
            <p>Currently, I'm at the end stage of a project to create a ray-traced render engine with OpenGL. Admittedly
                it's nothing too fancy in the realm of graphics engineering as a whole, but this was my semester project for my
                Advanced Computer Graphics class. In its present state, all I'm missing is a pretty major bug that's causing 
                the image to come out wrong. The theory is all there (and math more complex than I know what to do with), it's just a matter of getting all my data to the shader. 
            </p>
            <h4>This Website</h4>
            <p>You're looking right at it! I'm working on this website as both a portfolio piece and as a way to keep my web programming skills sharp. In another branch I'm 
                working on a WebGL app to show off my shader programming skills. Once I get it working I'll have a little graphics window below this. </p>
            <h3>Past Projects</h3>
            <h4><a href="graphics.html" class="cg-link">Intro to Computer Graphics Portfolio</a></h4>
            <p>This is one of my personal favorites by far! While my skills as a software engineer could be described as "jack of all trades," I found a particular love for 
                graphics programming while taking this class. We actually were tasked with maintaining a webpage as part of this class, detailing each project. For the sake of
                not cluttering up the projects page with a bunch of smaller stuff, I've made the title into a link. 
            </p>
            <h4>Advanced Software Engineering: AutoGrader 5e</h4>
            <p>During the summer of my junior year, I took Advanced Software Engineering at Mines. This class, that we called "field session," was my forst foray into a professional 
                software work setting. It was only a 6-week stint, which is why I don't include a description of it on the resume I upload to employers (unless it's a LinkedIn or 
                Indeed digital counterpart). 
            </p>
            <div class="project-img">
                <img src="images/autograder.png">
            </div>
            <p>The image above is just a single page of the website, detailing a problem that students can solve. This is a single-page application, created with a Vue.js front-end 
                and a Python Flask back-end (which also makes SQL queries to a database containing problems, their output solutions, and some placeholder student information). For 
                the sake of time on the project, we used Bootstrap CSS for the webpage's actual design. Over the course of the project, we used the Agile design process and continuously 
                checked with our client in the computer science department to make sure everything was up to par. This included regular code reviews and we managed our work with Scrum. 
            </p>
            <h4>Software Engineering: Clue</h4>
            <p>This was a huge, semester-long project in the fall semester of 2021. My partner and I were tasked with creating Clue over the course of the semester using nothing but our wits and 
                Java. 
            </p>
            <div class="project-img">
                <img src="images/clue.png">
            </div>
            <p>We used the Agile design process for this as well, continuously checking with our professor and TAs that our code and project were up to standard. We also utilized unit 
                testing with JUnit. It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot during that class and I believe the skills I gained set me apart. 
            </p>
            <h3>Research Projects</h3>
            <p>I worked on research for the MIRRORLab at Colorado School of Mines for a while, and was able to get two publications under my belt.</p>
            <h4>IPOWER: Incremental, Probabilistic, Open-World Reference Resolution</h4>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Referring expression understanding and generation are critical for robots to communicate about the world around them. Recently there have been significant 
                advances on the problem of referring expression understanding, also known as reference resolution, with researchers presenting approaches to both incremental reference resolution 
                (i.e., processing referring expressions word by word in real-time as they are spoken) and open-world reference resolution (i.e., resolving references both to known and previously 
                unknown entities). In this work, we combine insights from these approaches to present IPOWER: the first algorithm for performing reference resolution incrementally in open-world 
                environments.</p>

            <h4>Toward Forgetting-Sensitive Referring Expression Generation for Integrated Robot Architectures</h4>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To engage in human-like dialogue, robots require the ability to describe the objects, locations, and people in their environment, a capability known as 
                “Referring Expression Generation.” As speakers repeatedly refer to similar objects, they tend to re-use properties from previous descriptions, in part to help the listener, and in 
                part due to cognitive availability of those properties in working memory (WM). Because different theories of working memory ``forgetting'' necessarily lead to differences in cognitive 
                availability, we hypothesize that they will similarly result in generation of different referring expressions. To design effective intelligent agents, it is thus necessary to 
                determine how different models of forgetting may be differentially effective at producing natural human-like referring expressions. In this work, we computationalize two candidate 
                models of working memory forgetting within a robot cognitive architecture, and demonstrate how they lead to cognitive availability-based differences in generated referring expressions. </p>
