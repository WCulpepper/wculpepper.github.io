        <p>
            I am a current computer science student at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. In 2019, I moved here from
            Houston, Texas to pursue a computer science degree originally with the idea to pursue
            electrical engineering as a specialty...or to try and become Iron Man. Almost four years and two changes of
            major later, I settled on computer graphics as my primary aspiration after taking the class in the Fall 2021 semester.
