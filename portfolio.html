                <p>This class was my second step into coding in a professional setting. I worked on a team of other CS
                    students to build a web app to replace the Computer Science Department's current auto-grading system
                    for the major's introductory classes (CSCI 200, CSCI 220, CSCI 250, and more).
                    <br><br>
                    The primary motivator behind this project was to rebuild it in a codebase that was more maintainable
                    than the previous version. This web app, dubbed "AutoGrader 5.0," is built on a Flask back-end and a
                    Vue.js front-end. Additionally, the back-end makes queries to a PostgreSQL database used for storing
                    the programming challenges the faculty uses. Furthermore, we were tasked with making the new AutoGrader
                    compatible with a screen reader, as differently-abled students are not able to access the site with
                    the same level of ease as a normally-abled student. The new version of the site is served on a
                    single-page application, and is fully compatible with a screen reader (tested with NVDA).
                    <br><br>
                    This project was tough, in all honesty. Neither I nor any of my teammates had any experience with web
                    programming (you can probably tell, the CSS we used to customize the site is Bootstrap). Nevertheless,
                    we were able to get a product to the client that was both up to their standards and an improvement upon
                    the previous version. I ended the project having acquired skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and expanding
                    on my Python skills with both a server implementation and SQL integration.

                <p>This class was my first step into coding in a professional setting. Important things we covered were
                    the Agile software design process and test-driven development, all using Java (and JUnit). Over the
                    course of the semester, my partner and I were able to recreate a version of Clue as a computer game.

                This class reignited my passion for computer science, and is the primary focus of what I want to do with
                my degree once I graduate. Here I learned OpenGL and its use in C++, creating graphics almost entirely
                from scratch. I learned shader programming and all the intermediary steps from vertex data to screen
                output (everything from creating the initial vertex buffers to the fragment shader, including tessellation control/evaluation
                and geometry). I learned how to generate Bezier curves and move objects along them. I learned about
                particle systems and collision detection. I learned about lighting models (Gouraud shading, Phong/Blinn-Phong
                illumination) and all kinds of fragment shaders (I even wrote a Cel shader!). Near the end of the semester,
                I even learned the basics of ray tracing. This class was a blast, and is the reason I still code. I made
                a portfolio of the work I did in class throughout the semester, which can be found <a href="graphics.html">here</a>.

            <h5>Computer Science</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>CSCI 101 - Introduction to CS: to sum it up, we just answered the question, "What is Computer Science?"</li>
                <li>CSCI 102 - Intro to CS Lab: I actually had a job for two semesters as a TA for this class. I taught
                    Python to people who had little-to-no coding experience.</li>
                <li>CSCI 250 - Building a Sensor System: Python-based class that integrated hardware and introductory
                    data science concepts. Acquired and developed skills in Python programming, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and
                    basic data processing (filters, visualization). Also was a TA for this class for two semesters.</li>
                <li>CSCI 262 - Data Structures: learned the basics of modern data structures. Linked lists, stacks, queues,
                    maps, sets, you name it. This class was a particularly tough challenge, since I had never used C++
                    before entering. I came out of it with more than I went in, including a desire to become an electrical
                    engineer. That desire lasted exactly one semester before I realized just how much I like coding.</li>
                <li>CSCI 274 - Introduction to Linux: Here, I learned the basic of Linux (Ubuntu) and the command line.</li>
                <li>CSCI 341 - Computer Organization: Assembly, memory, registers, process optimization. This class was tough, but since I took
                    a digital logic course the semester prior I had a leg up on the course going in.</li>
                <li>CSCI 358 - Discrete Mathematics: logic, proofs, recursion, algorithm analysis, sets, relations,
                    Boolean algebra, trees, and finite-state machines. I had a lot of fun in this class, and it was the
                    easiest non-code-based class to wrap my head around.</li>
                <li>CSCI 400 - Programming Languages: Functional programming, lambda calculus, higher-order functions,
                    syntax, types, and language evaluation. My project group ended up with a very simple JavaScript
                    interpreter by the end of the semester.</li>
                <li>CSCI 403 - Database Management: relational databases, SQL, and data storage. Near the end of the
                    semester we had a project to make assessments from large data sets about homicide rates and housing
                    prices in California.</li>
                <li>CSCI 404 - Artificial Intelligence: Intro AI topics. Search, probabilistic logic, neural networks,
                    genetic algorithms, and more.</li>
                <li>CSCI 477 - Elements of Games and Game Development: Overview of game development, including gameplay,
                    game design, game mechanics, story/character/world development, and game interfaces. </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="card-section"><p>You've reached the end of my portfolio, so far. <br>This was a fun little project.
            I wanted to have something in this website that showed that I can work with graphics in a multitude of
            environments, so I followed<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API" target="_blank">
                Mozilla's tutorial on WebGL.</a>
            The pipeline is pretty much identical to OpenGL, so it was easy to wrap my head around. This cube currently
            has three shader options: Gouraud shading, Phong shading, and Cel shading. All of which use the Phong
            Illumination Model. The shaders below use the Phong Illumination model (with Blinn-Phong specular). Currently,
            the shaders are not exhibiting their expected behavior. </p>
